stay on message is the chant i always do  trade jobs military vets 2nd a repeal ocare borders etc  but media misrepresents
i have always been the same personremain true to selfthe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
i am not only fighting crooked hillary i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process people get it
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media she is not a talented person or politician the dishonest media refuses to expose
my rallies are not covered properly by the media they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words i say i would be beating hillary by 20
the failing nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change false i am who i amnever said
the failing nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened their reporting is fiction the media protects hillary

hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety
hillary will never reform wall street she is owned by wall street
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words
hillarys refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a 550 increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country

not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition  sad
funny how the failing nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america 1st
as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv
just like i have warned from the beginning crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp httpstcoeontwk6i8y
many of bernies supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight  thanks megynkelly
for the record i have zero investments in russia
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy
dems dont want to talk isis bc hillarys foreign interventions unleashed isis amp her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
bernies exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar

pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch
why arent the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great
funny if you listen to foxnews the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself
i was at foxnews and met juan williams in passing  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers
clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war

great poll numbers are coming out all over people dont want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse maga
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc  they just got caught thats all they laughed at bernie
if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same
thank you makeamericagreatagain httpstcopzs9uwgzam
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes no way they are going to fix americas problems isis amp all others laughing
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory shes out
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive amp well
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i dont believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild
the cnn panels are so one sided almost all against trump foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher dont watch cnn
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left
today proves what i have always known that reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz dwstweets
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just cant go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite
wow president obamas brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect
the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart
the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they dont look presidential to me
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged
pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight
theresacali realdonaldtrump general michael flynn will make a great secretary of defense when you become potus makeamericasafeagain

in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs
bill hemmer of foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena more than in past years

if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didnt lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today pick her h
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her vp then we can litigate her fraud
it doesnt matter that crooked hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made bernie said she has bad judgement
as the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country and world is in  crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions
we are going to have a great time in cleveland will lead to special results for our country we will make america great again

crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis  it will just go on forever we need change

i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the usag so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the usag in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away no pictures
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the usag talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac
the system is rigged
on saturday a great man elie wiesel passed awaythe world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the usag to work out a deal the system is totally rigged amp corrupt
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the usag was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know
just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd and the entire show is against methe good newsthe people get it
it was just announcedby sourcesthat no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton like i said the system is totally rigged

remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing nytimes wrote a critical article i was so right
these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better
lindseygrahamsc and lyin ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike  all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing
it is amazing how lindseygrahamsc gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run

just saw the phony ad by cruz  totally false more dirty tricks he got caught in so many lies  is this man crazy

ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false  no basis in fact take ad down ted biggest liar in politics
wow ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director more dirty tricks

dr ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies
cruz just lied again i am and have been totally against obamacare repeal and replace
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud
this was sent out from ted cruz as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote cruzfraud httpstcotrm7kucrsu
i will be interviewed on greta at 700 pm enjoy foxnews
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice  a total lie
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that realbencarson was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz
ted cruz didnt win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad

wow just saw an ad  cruz is lying on so many levels there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal amp replace he lies

amazing that ted cruz cant even get a senator like bensasse who is easy to endorse him not one senator  is endorsing canada ted
bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a us senator how the hell did he ever get elected  greta
the great state of nebraska can do much better than bensasse as your senator saw him on greta  totally ineffective wants paid for pols

greatly dishonest of tedcruz to file a financial disclosure form amp not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up wall st
when will tedcruz give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him
everybody that loves the people of new york and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage
ted is the ultimate hypocrite says one thing for money does another for votes httpstcohxdfy0mjvw
great new numbers thank you makeamericagreatagain trump2016httpstcoz1lqdxqvrl httpstcogfynuwwcyn
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks
oh no just reported that ted cruz didnt report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wifes employer and his lender is located there
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand not much of a reformer
ted cruz said he didnt know that he was a canadian citizen he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million  loan papersnot believable
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow i told you so
more radical islam attacks today  it never ends strengthen the borders we must be vigilant and smart no more being politically correct
